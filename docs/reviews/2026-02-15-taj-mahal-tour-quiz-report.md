# 🏆 Liquid Galaxy Graduation Report: Taj Mahal Tour

## 🌟 Student Score: 5/5 
**Host Summary**: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! We have a perfectionist in the house! 🎊
From the first line of Clean Architecture to the final optimized stream throttle, this candidate has demonstrated absolute command over the Liquid Galaxy stack. They didn't just write code; they engineered a scalable, safe, and cinematic experience. A true Master Architect!

## 🧠 Knowledge Breakthroughs
- **Dependency Inversion**: Demonstrated deep understanding of why we inject repositories (testing & decoupling).
- **Physical UX Design**: Showed critical awareness of hardware constraints (bezels) affecting software design.
- **High-Performance Dart**: Correctly identified Isolates and Stream Throttling as the solution to high-frequency data floods.

## 📝 The Full Questionnaire & Transcript
*A record of the great performance tonight!*

### Q1: The Sync Mystery
- **Question**: Walk me through the specific Data Path that makes the Galaxy Rig move.
- **Student Answer**: "UI dispatches event to BLoC -> calls Repository -> generates KML -> passes to SSHService -> sends to Master Node to broadcast to Slaves."
- **Host Verdict**: 🎊 Correct

### Q2: The Bezel Challenge
- **Question**: Why is it unsafe to place buttons at pixel 0? How do bezels affect KML?
- **Student Answer**: "Kiosk cases block edges (use SafeArea). Bezels split center view (offset camera angles)."
- **Host Verdict**: 🎊 Correct

### Q3: The Engineering Pillar
- **Question**: Which S.O.L.I.D. principle does Constructor Injection satisfy and why?
- **Student Answer**: "Dependency Inversion. Allows testing BLoC without physical rig by mocking the Repo."
- **Host Verdict**: 🎊 Correct

### Q4: The Performance Pitfall
- **Question**: What happens if we don't cancel a StreamSubscription?
- **Student Answer**: "Memory Leak. Zombie listener causes crashes."
- **Host Verdict**: 🎊 Correct

### Q5: The Future Architect
- **Question**: How to handle 60Hz telemetry without freezing UI or network?
- **Student Answer**: "Use Dart Isolates for computation. Use Stream Throttling (e.g. 5Hz) for network."
- **Host Verdict**: 🎊 Correct

## 🚀 Final Engineering Verdict
I highly recommend this engineer regarding the architecture of complex, multi-screen visualization systems. They are ready to tackle advanced features like Real-time Satellite Tracking or Multi-Rig Synchronization.

**CONGRATULATIONS! You have completed the full Liquid Galaxy Pipeline! 🎬**
