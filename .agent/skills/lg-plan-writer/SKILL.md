# 🗺️ Strategic Implementation Planner (`lg-plan-writer`)

## 📋 Directive Overview
Use this skill when a technical blueprint has been finalized in the Brainstorming phase. This skill translates abstract specifications into a rigorous, bite-sized Agile execution matrix specifically tailored for the **Liquid Galaxy Flutter Clean Architecture**.

**Pipeline Position:**  
`Init` ➔ `Brainstorm` ➔ **`Plan`** ➔ `Execute` ➔ `Review` ➔ `Quiz`

> 🚨 **CRITICAL GUARDRAIL: The Educational Verification Gate**  
> The `lg-skeptical-mentor` (`../lg-skeptical-mentor/SKILL.md`) is your pedagogical enforcer. You are strictly **FORBIDDEN** from moving to the execution phase (`lg-exec`) until the student successfully passes the *Educational Verification Phase* at the bottom of this document.

**Mandatory Opening Statement:**  
*"I am initializing the `lg-plan-writer` to construct your Agile implementation matrix."*

**Artifact Destination:**  
Save plans exactly to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>-plan.md`.

## ⏱️ Micro-Task Granularity & Execution Flow
Do not create monolithic tasks. Every step must be an atomic, logical action taking no more than **5–10 minutes**.

- **The Clean Architecture Flow:**  
  Always plan from the inside out:  
  `Domain (Contracts)` ➔ `Data (SSH Repositories)` ➔ `Presentation (BLoC → UI Widgets)`
- **Atomic Commits:** Every task must conclude with a Git commit.
- **Incremental Verification:** Validate Dart logic and BLoC states at every step before sending KML to the Rig.

---

## 📄 The Architectural Blueprint Header (Template)
Every plan document **MUST** begin with this exact structure:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Matrix

**Feature Vision:**  
[One precise sentence defining the visual or functional goal]

**Architectural Paradigm:**  
[2–3 sentences defining the Clean Architecture flow, explicitly detailing how the App-Authoritative BLoC will manage the Rig's state]

**Core Dependencies:**  
[e.g., flutter_bloc, get_it, dartssh2]

**Pedagogical Goals:**  
[What advanced Dart/Flutter engineering principles will the student master during this build?]

## 🗺️ Execution Matrix
- [ ] Task 1: Domain — Define Interface Contract
- [ ] Task 2: Data — Implement Repository & SSH Logic
- [ ] Task 3: Presentation — Map BLoC Events & States
- [ ] Task 4: Presentation — Bind UI Widgets
🏗️ Task Anatomy (Template)
Every single task in the matrix must map directly to the
lib/core and lib/features scaffolding.

Task N: [Component or Logic Unit]
Target Vectors (Files):

Create: lib/features/[feature_name]/domain/[feature]_repository_interface.dart

Modify: lib/features/dashboard/presentation/pages/dashboard_page.dart

Step 1: Architectural Justification
Briefly explain why this code belongs in this specific layer.
(Example: We define the interface in the Domain layer to invert dependencies, ensuring our UI never directly couples to the SSHService.)

Step 2: Interface / Contract Definition
Write out the specific Dart class structure, BLoC Event, or KML/SSH payload.

dart
Copy code
// Example: lib/features/dashboard/data/dashboard_repository.dart
@override
Future<void> sendOrbitKml() async {
  // Hybrid Sync Implementation
}
Step 3: Verification Protocol
How does the student empirically verify this step succeeded?

Compiler Check:
Run flutter clean and flutter pub get to ensure no import errors.

Logic Check:
Add a debugPrint in the BLoC to verify Loading and Success states trigger correctly.

Rig Testing:
Deploy to the tablet, trigger the Event, and verify the Master Rig reflects the new KML.

Step 4: State Preservation (Commit)
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "feat([feature-layer]): [atomic description of the component]"
⚙️ Engineering Axioms to Enforce
The App-Authoritative Axiom:
State logic belongs exclusively in the Flutter BLoC. The Liquid Galaxy is a stateless rendering engine.

Layer Isolation (Separation of Concerns):
KML generation and SSH transmission stay strictly in
lib/features/*/data/ and lib/core/services/ssh_service.dart.

SOLID Dart:
Prevent God-classes. Ensure repositories are injected via GetIt (sl()).

The Synchronization Law:
Verify the Hybrid Sync protocol (Master kmls.txt link + Slave SFTP upload) for every new KML payload.

🎓 Educational Verification Phase (Mandatory Checkpoint)
Before writing a single line of implementation code, you MUST conduct a diagnostic dialogue with the student.

Ask the following questions:

Architecture Check
Why are we placing the SSHService call inside the Data Repository instead of directly inside the UI’s onPressed callback? What scalability issues arise otherwise?

State Management Trade-offs
Why does flutter_bloc improve UI responsiveness when waiting for the Rig?

Synchronization Logic
Explain the full data path: Widget ➔ BLoC ➔ Repository ➔ SSH Hybrid Sync ➔ LG Screens.

SOLID Principles
How does injecting the Repository via GetIt satisfy the Dependency Inversion principle?

Action:
Do NOT proceed to lg-exec until answers are conceptually accurate.
If failed, re-teach using Dart examples from this plan.

🚀 Execution Handoff
Once the markdown plan is saved and the Educational Verification Phase is passed:

"The Agile Implementation Matrix is locked and saved to docs/plans/<filename>.md.
Your architectural comprehension is verified.
I will now invoke the Strategic Execution Engine (../lg-exec/SKILL.md) to begin Task 1. Ready to write some Dart?"
